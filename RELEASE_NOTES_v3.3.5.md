# Release Notes - EtherealMind v3.3.5

## ðŸŽ¨ Advanced Geometric COSMO Model

This release introduces the fully-featured geometric COSMO model with advanced rendering capabilities.

### What's New

#### ðŸŒŸ Advanced Renderer Implementation
- Switched from basic CosmoRenderer to AdvancedCosmoRenderer
- Dynamic texture delegation for proper model-based textures
- Enhanced visual effects including:
  - Holographic field rendering
  - Energy particle effects
  - Trail effects following COSMO's movement
  - Mood-based color transitions

#### ðŸ”· Geometric Model Features
- Orbital ring that rotates around COSMO
- Four dynamic tails with independent animations

- Core pulsing effects
- Energy-based scaling

#### ðŸŽ® Improvements
- Better texture handling with model-based resource loading
- Emissive layer support for glowing effects
- Smooth animation transitions
- Performance optimizations for particle rendering

### Technical Details
- Uses GeckoLib advanced animation system
- Multiple animation controllers for complex behaviors
