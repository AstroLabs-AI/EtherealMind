## üëª COSMO Problems

### COSMO Won't Spawn

**Issue:** Right-clicking spawn egg does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Player Limit**
   - Each player can only have ONE COSMO
   - If you already have one, new ones won't spawn

2. **Space Requirements**
   - Need 3x3x3 clear space
   - Cannot spawn in water or lava
   - Must be in valid dimension

3. **Permission Issues**
   - In multiplayer, check spawn permissions
   - Some servers restrict entity spawning

### COSMO Is Invisible

**Issue:** COSMO spawned but can't see it

**Solutions:**
1. **Update Mod Version**
   - Versions before 1.2.1 had transparency issues
   - Download latest version

2. **Graphics Settings**
   - Enable particles in video settings
   - Set entity render distance higher
   - Turn on entity shadows

3. **Resource Pack Conflicts**
   - Disable resource packs temporarily
   - Some packs override entity textures

### COSMO Not Following

**Issue:** COSMO stays in place, doesn't follow player

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Bonding**
   - Right-click COSMO to ensure bonded
   - Only bonded player is followed

2. **Distance Check**
   - If >50 blocks away, COSMO should teleport
   - Check if teleportation is working

3. **Chunk Loading**
   - COSMO might be in unloaded chunk
   - Return to spawn location

## üì¶ Storage Issues

### Storage GUI Won't Open

**Issue:** Right-clicking COSMO doesn't open storage

**Solutions:**
1. **Interaction Check**
   - Must right-click directly on COSMO
   - Not while sneaking (that sets home)
   - Check if you're bonded player

2. **GUI Conflicts**
   - Disable other GUI mods temporarily
   - Check for keybind conflicts

3. **Server Sync**
   - In multiplayer, may have sync issues
   - Try relogging

### Items Disappearing

**Issue:** Items vanish when placed in storage

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Storage Limit**
   - Use `/cosmo stats` to see capacity
   - Higher levels = more storage

2. **Save Issues**
   - Items save when GUI closes
   - Don't force-quit game with GUI open

3. **Auto-Deposit**
   - Check if auto-deposit is enabled
   - Items might be auto-stored

### Container Click Crash

**Error:** `NullPointerException: Container click`

**Solution:**
- Update to version 1.2.1 or later
- This was fixed in recent versions
- If persists, report with crash log

## ‚ö° Performance Problems

### FPS Drops Near COSMO

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce Particles**
   - Lower particle settings in video options
   - Disable particles if severe

2. **Entity Limit**
   - Too many entities in area
   - Move COSMO to less crowded area

3. **Storage Size**
   - Very full storage can impact performance
   - Organize and remove unnecessary items

### Lag When Opening Storage

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce Page Count**
   - Only use pages you need
   - Higher levels = more lag potential

2. **Clear Cache**
   - Close and reopen Minecraft
   - Delete `.minecraft/cosmo_cache` if exists
