# COSMO Texture/Model Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Broken Appearance:

### 1. Reverted to Stable Configuration
- **Model**: Using `cosmo_cute.geo.json` (known working model)
- **Texture**: Created new `cosmo_cute_proper.png` (128x128 to match model UV)
- **Renderer**: Switched back to standard `CosmoRenderer` from `AdvancedCosmoRenderer`
- **Animations**: Using `cosmo_cute.animation.json`

### 2. Fixed Texture Issues
- Original `cosmo_cute.png` was only 64x64 but model expects 128x128
- Created properly sized texture with correct UV mapping:
  - Body faces at correct positions (24x24 each)
  - Antenna at UV position 120,0
  - Proper face with eyes and smile on front

### 3. Configuration Updates
- `CosmoModel.java`: Now loads cute model with proper texture
- `ClientProxy.java`: Uses standard renderer for stability

## Why Previous Versions Failed:
1. **Advanced Model Too Complex**: 50+ bones with complex UV mapping
2. **Texture Size Mismatch**: Models expecting different texture sizes
3. **UV Coordinate Issues**: Texture regions not matching model expectations
4. **Renderer Conflicts**: Advanced renderer adding effects that broke appearance

## Current State:
- COSMO uses cute model with friendly appearance
- Properly sized 128x128 texture with:
  - Soft blue body
  - Cute face with eyes and smile
  - LED accents
  - Simple but effective design
- Standard renderer for stability
- All basic animations working

## Files to Include in Release:
- `/src/main/resources/assets/etherealmind/textures/entity/cosmo_cute_proper.png`
- Updated `CosmoModel.java`
- Updated `ClientProxy.java`
