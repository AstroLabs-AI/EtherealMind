# EtherealMind v3.3.2 - Model & Texture Fix 🔧🤖

## 🐛 Critical Fixes

### Fixed COSMO Model/Texture Loading Issues
- **Problem**: COSMO still appeared broken/monstrous due to model complexity and UV mapping issues
- **Solution**: Reverted to stable cute model with properly sized texture

## 🎨 What's Fixed

### Stable Model Configuration
- Using proven `cosmo_cute.geo.json` model
- Created new `cosmo_cute_proper.png` texture (128x128)
- Switched to standard renderer for reliability
- All animations working correctly

### Visual Appearance
- **Body**: Soft blue rounded cube
- **Face**: Dark blue plate with white eyes and cyan pupils
- **Expression**: Friendly smile
- **Details**: LED accents and glowing antenna tip

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Updated
- `cosmo_cute_proper.png` - Properly sized 128x128 texture
- `CosmoModel.java` - Fixed texture loading path
- `ClientProxy.java` - Using standard renderer
- Removed complex advanced model temporarily

### Why This Fix Works
- Model and texture sizes now match (128x128)
- UV coordinates properly aligned
- Simpler geometry prevents rendering issues
- Standard renderer ensures compatibility

## 📝 Notes
- This release prioritizes stability over complexity
- COSMO will appear as a cute, simple companion
- Advanced features will be re-introduced in future updates
- All core functionality remains intact
