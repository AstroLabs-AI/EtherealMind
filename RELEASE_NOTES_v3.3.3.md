# EtherealMind v3.3.3 - Transparency Fix 👻➡️🤖

## 🐛 Quick Fix

### Fixed COSMO Transparency Issue
- **Problem**: COSMO was appearing transparent/see-through like a ghost
- **Solution**: Changed render type to make COSMO solid and opaque

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Changed
- Renderer now uses `entityCutoutNoCull` instead of `entityTranslucent`
- This makes COSMO appear solid while preserving texture details

### Result
- ✅ COSMO is now fully opaque and visible
- ✅ Blue body appears solid
- ✅ All features clearly visible
- ✅ No more see-through effect

## 📝 Files Updated
- `CosmoRenderer.java` - Fixed render type

## 🚀 Installation
Simply replace your mod file. The fix applies immediately to all COSMO entities.
