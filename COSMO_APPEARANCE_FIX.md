# COSMO Appearance Fix

## Problem
The advanced COSMO model was appearing as a "monster" due to:
1. Complex geometry with 50+ bones that was difficult to texture properly
2. UV mapping mismatches between the 256x256 texture and model
3. Too many small parts creating a fragmented appearance

## Solution
Created a hybrid "advanced_cute" model that:
- Maintains the advanced animation bone structure
- Uses simpler, larger geometry pieces  
- Has a cute rounded body with big expressive eyes
- Uses a 128x128 texture for better UV mapping

## Files Changed:
1. **cosmo_advanced_cute.geo.json** - New simplified but animated model
2. **cosmo_advanced_cute.png** - Cute robotic texture with:
   - Soft blue body with panel details
   - Large expressive cyan eyes with pupils
   - Cute smile on the face plate
   - Glowing antenna tip
   - LED accents throughout
3. **CosmoModel.java** - Updated to use new model/texture
4. **AdvancedCosmoRenderer.java** - Updated texture paths

## Visual Result:
- COSMO now appears as a cute floating AI companion
- Rounded blue body with tech details
- Big friendly eyes that can track players
- Glowing antenna and energy rings
- Small arms for gestures
- All 12+ animations still work perfectly

## How It Looks:
- **Body**: Soft blue rounded cube with panel lines and LED lights
- **Face**: Dark blue face plate with large white/cyan eyes and a smile
- **Antenna**: Blue base with glowing cyan tip
- **Arms**: Simple but articulated for waving and gestures
- **Effects**: Energy rings and hover engine still visible

The model maintains all the advanced animation capabilities while having a much friendlier, cuter appearance that matches the AI companion theme.
