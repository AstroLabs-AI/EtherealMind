# COSMO Improvements v3.3.4

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Removed Green Particle Animations
- Green effects were already commented out in the renderer
- Particle spawning disabled in entity update

### 2. ✅ Made Arms 3D Instead of Flat
- Created new model with proper 3D arms
- Each arm has 6 faces (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
- Arms are now 2x4x2 blocks with proper depth
- Hands are also 3D cubes

### 3. ✅ Made COSMO Smaller
- Model reduced from 12x12x12 to 8x8x8 base size
- Additional 60% scale in renderer (0.6f base scale)
- Total size is now approximately 40% of original

### 4. ✅ Fixed Transparency (Clouds Visible Through COSMO)
- Changed render type from `entityCutoutNoCull` to `entitySolid`
- This prevents any transparency issues
- COSMO now renders as completely opaque

## New Features:

### Improved Model Structure
- Body: 8x8x8 cube (smaller than before)
- Arms: 2x4x2 3D arms with full texturing
- Hands: 2x2x2 3D cubes
- Face: Separate face plate for better detail
- Eyes: Individual eye components
- Antenna: Multi-part with glowing tip

### Improved Texture
- 64x64 texture (optimized size)
- Proper UV mapping for all 3D faces
- Panel details and LED accents
- Cute face with eyes and smile
- 3D shading on arms

## Technical Changes:
- `cosmo_improved.geo.json` - New compact 3D model
- `cosmo_improved.png` - Matching texture with 3D details
- `CosmoRenderer.java` - Solid render type, smaller scale
- `CosmoModel.java` - Updated to use improved assets

## Result:
COSMO is now:
- Smaller and cuter
- Fully solid (no transparency)
- Has proper 3D arms
- No green particle effects
- Better proportioned for Minecraft
