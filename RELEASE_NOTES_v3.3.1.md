# EtherealMind v3.3.1 - Appearance Hotfix 🤖💙

## 🐛 Critical Fix

### Fixed COSMO's Appearance
- **Issue**: COSMO was appearing as a "monster" due to complex geometry and UV mapping issues
- **Solution**: Created a new "advanced_cute" model that maintains all animations while looking friendly

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### New Cute Design
- **Soft Blue Body**: Rounded cube design with a friendly appearance
- **Expressive Eyes**: Large white eyes with bright cyan irises and pupils
- **Happy Face**: Cute smile on the face plate
- **Glowing Elements**: LED accents and glowing antenna tip
- **Tech Details**: Panel lines and circuit patterns for a robotic look

### Technical Changes
- Simplified model geometry while keeping all 20+ animation bones
- Reduced texture size from 256x256 to 128x128 for better UV mapping
- Fixed texture coordinate alignment issues
- Maintained all 12+ animations functionality

## 📝 Files Updated
- `cosmo_advanced_cute.geo.json` - New hybrid model
- `cosmo_advanced_cute.png` - Properly mapped texture
- Model and renderer configurations

## 🎮 What This Means
- COSMO now looks like a cute AI companion as intended
- All animations still work perfectly (wave, thumbs up, thinking, etc.)
- Better performance with simplified geometry
- No gameplay changes - purely visual fix

## 🚀 Installation
Simply replace your current mod file with this version. All existing COSMO entities will automatically use the new appearance.
