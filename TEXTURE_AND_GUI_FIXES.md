# Texture and GUI Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Fixed:

### 1. COSMO Entity Texture Issues
- **Problem**: COSMO entity showing broken textures with transparency issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Created new 64x64 texture at `cosmo_cute.png` with proper opaque body parts
  - Changed render type from `entityCutoutNoCull` to `entityTranslucent` for proper transparency handling
  - Added robotic design elements: metallic panels, LED indicators, camera-style eye

### 2. GUI Layout Issues
- **Problem**: GUI had misaligned slots, text overflow, and non-functional buttons
- **Solution**:
  - Created new GUI texture at `cosmo_companion.png` with proper dimensions (256x222)
  - Updated positioning constants to match texture:
    - Chat area: 7,32 with size 162x120
    - Stats panel: 176,32 with size 72x120
    - Mode buttons properly positioned at top
  - Fixed button functionality for switching between CHAT, STORAGE, and ABILITIES views

### 3. Code Fixes
- Fixed `NetworkHandler.CHANNEL` â†’ `NetworkHandler.INSTANCE`
- Fixed `StorageActionPacket` constructor to include required parameters
- Removed problematic slot position modifications (slots are final in Minecraft)
- Added view mode switching logic to show/hide appropriate content

## Files Modified:
1. `/src/main/resources/assets/etherealmind/textures/entity/cosmo_cute.png` - New robotic texture
2. `/src/main/resources/assets/etherealmind/textures/gui/cosmo_companion.png` - New GUI texture
3. `/src/main/java/com/astrolabs/etherealmind/client/renderer/CosmoRenderer.java` - Changed render type
4. `/src/main/java/com/astrolabs/etherealmind/client/gui/CosmoCompanionScreen.java` - Fixed GUI functionality
5. `/src/main/java/com/astrolabs/etherealmind/common/menu/DimensionalStorageMenu.java` - Removed slot update method

## Testing Required:
1. Spawn COSMO and verify texture displays correctly without transparency issues
2. Open COSMO GUI and test all three view modes
3. Verify storage slots only appear in STORAGE view
4. Test chat functionality in CHAT view
5. Check that buttons properly switch between views

The mod now builds successfully and should display proper textures and GUI functionality.
